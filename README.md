# ⚡ About MyFin

MyFin originated as my own passion project in 2020. At that point, I'd already tried a bunch of other FPM's, but all of
them lacked in at least one of the following points:

- They were not user-friendly
- Their features lacked a full-fledged budgeting tool
- I was never in control of my own data

MyFin is my <u>attempt</u> to solve all of these issues. It has helped me manage my finances for a while now and I hope
it can be useful for you as well.
